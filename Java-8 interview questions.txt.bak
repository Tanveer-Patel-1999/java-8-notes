Java-8 interview questions
==========================
1 : why we need java8?
2 : significant of java8?
3 : what are new features introduce in java8? 7
4 : what is the functionalInterface?
5 : Function interface is also called as what? --> SAM
6 : Function interface present in which package? --> java.util.function Package
7 : what is differnce between normal Interafce and functional interface?
8 : what is mean by anonymous function / method?
9 : what is mean by lambda and synatx?
10: differnce b/w lambda and method?
11: when we used a curley  " { } " bracket in lambda and not ?
12: used of Runnable interface with lambda expression? --> run()
13: used of Comparator interface with lambda expression? --> compare() --->compareTo()
14: what is mean by methodRefernce and syntax?
15: types of methodRefernce? 3
16: " :: " this means what in the methodreference ? ::
17: what is mean by lambda local varaiable?

18: Piller interface  or functionalInterface of java-8 / core of java 8 ?
	1: Consumer
	2: Predicate
	3: Function
	4: Supplier
19: what is a consumer Interface?
20: How many method present in the consumerInterface? : process the data  : contain only one parameter : (a) -> sout(a);
	1 : accept()
	2 : andThen()
21: what is mean by BiConsumer Interface?
22: How many method present in the consumerInterface? : process the data  : contain only two parameter : (a,b) -> sout(a+b);
	1 : accept()
	2 : andThen()
23: what is Predicate interface?  :  test or validate the some data : contain only one parameter : (a) -> a > 5 ;
24: How many method present in the Predicate have following method
	1: test() 	: It return boolean value based on condition
	2: and()	: It return true if both condition is satiesfied else fale
	3: or()		: It return true if one condition is satiesfied else false
	4: negate()	: It return the reverse the output. 
25: what is BiPredicate interface?  :  test or validate the some data : contain only two parameter : (a,b) -> a+b > 5
26: How many method present in the BiPredicate have following method
	1: test() 	: It return boolean value based on condition
	2: and()	: It return true if both condition is satiesfied else fale
	3: or()		: It return true if one condition is satiesfied else false
	4: negate()	: It return the reverse the output. 
27: what is function interface ? : return some data  : contain two parameter : [ input and outPut] : (a,b) -> a + 5;
28: function Interface have following abstract methodes
	1 : apply()   : pass the argument
	2 : compose() : new function will generate : it is a reverse of andThen()  : it work left to right
	3 : andThen() : new function will generate : it take result of first function as a input of second function : it work right to left
	4 : identity() : what u provide as an input it give same output : it is a static method call with Interafce name. it not do any things
29: what is Bifunction interface ? : return some data  : contain 3 parameter : [ input, input and outPut] : (a,b) -> 
30: Bifunction Interface have following abstract methodes
	1 : apply()   : pass the argument
	2 : andThen() : new function will generate : it take result of first function as a input of second function : it work right to left 
31: what is mean by Supplier Interface? : it does not take parameter on int : it is supply  data to the client. () -> new Random().nextInt();
